# What is Git merge conflits?

* Conflicts generally arise 

    - when two people have changed the same line in file

    - one person delete the file while other person trying to modify the same file

* While this situation happens Git cannot automatically determine what is correct isn't

* That's where it becomes our responsibility to fix the conflict and merge the changes

# Let's try an example here

* We shall create a file with certain lines and commit the changes to Git repo (main branch)

```
sample README.md file which is already in main branch

# This is the readme file created to understand the product code
  
- This code has 3 folders
- Payment - Created to enable payment authentication
- Otp     - Created to enable Otp authentication
- Login   - Created to enable Login authentication
```

* Let's assume 2 people are working with this code repository

* `Person A & Person B` : 

    - Both think that there should be some changes needed with the file what we created 

    - Note: Files is already exist in main branch

# Person A : (machine 1)

* clone the repo to local machine

* creating new branch

* updating the file with new content

```
sample update

# This is the readme file created to understand the product code
  
- This code has 3 folders
- Payment - Created to enable payment gateway's
- Otp     - Created to enable Otp access        
- Login   - Created to enable Login access
```

* making a commit 

* but holding the merge with main branch

# Person B : (machine 2)

* clone the repo to local machine

* creating new branch

* updating the file with new content

```
sample update

# This is the readme file created to understand the product code
  
- This code has 3 folders
- Payment - Folder to enable payment gateway
- Otp     - Folder to enable Otp access        
- Login   - Folder to enable Login access
```

* making a commit 

* merge with main branch as well

# Merge conflict 

* Now if `person A` try to merge the code now after creating the PR there will be an conflict 

* `person A & B` should talk to resolve the conflicts

# How to resolve? (Resolve to be done in Person A machine in this case)

* git pull

* vi README.md

* Delete the decided lines that can be removed

* git add `modified file`

* git commit

* git push orgin head
